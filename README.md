# Challenge 1

## Description

The challenge for this assignment was to refactor existing code for a mock marketing agency. The task was to make it more accessible to meet standards that will allow the website to be optimitized for search engines. 

I learned how to title a website and use the alt attribute to add image descriptions that will allow people with visual disabilities to interact with the webpage. I was able to discover that using the HTML attributes role and aria-label allowed me to add  a image description for the background image property set in the CSS file. Additionally, I utilized better HTML sectioning elements names to easily identify code structure and add classes to consolidate the CSS file.

Navigate to the arrow in the top left of the corner of the panel and select it, then hover mouse arrow over images to look at image descriptions.
