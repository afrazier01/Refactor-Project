# Challenge 1

## Description

The challenge for this assignment was to refactor existing code for a mock marketing agency. The task was to make it more accessible to meet standards that will allow the website to be optimitized for search engines. 

I learned how to title a website and use the alt attribute to add image descriptions that will allow people with visual disabilities to interact with the webpage. Additionally, I utilized better HTML elements to easily identify code structure and added classes to consolidate the CSS file.
